My experience across various domains enables me to create robust and scalable solutions tailored to specific business needs. I strive to leverage my diverse skill set to drive innovation and deliver solutions that address challenges and explore the world of technology.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `With an honors degree in BE Computer Engineering and a passion for innovation, I have cultivated a fulfilling and dynamic journey in technology. My academic foundation, complemented by an impactful internship at Open Destinations Pvt Ltd, laid the groundwork for my expertise in Python, Java, ReactJS, SQL, .NET, C/C++, and advanced tools like scikit-learn, PyTorch, and OpenCV.

A highlight of my journey is the publication of my research paper, "Gesture Control System for Drones: Enhancing Human-Drone Interaction through Real-Time Machine Learning and Depth Sensing," in a Springer journal. This project demonstrated my ability to bridge theoretical knowledge and practical application, leveraging machine learning to enhance human-drone interaction.

Currently, I am working at Appstrail Technology as a Mulesoft and Salesforce Admin Developer, where I manage integration and automation solutions to optimize business processes. In addition, I am actively learning Apex programming to deepen my expertise in Salesforce development and further expand my technical repertoire.`;
